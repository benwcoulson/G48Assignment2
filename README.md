<br>Benjamin Coulson (S3849697)  {S3849697@student.rmit.edu.au} <br>
My background is basically full Australian with a little bit of English on my grandfather’s side therefore I only speak English, I have only completed high school, and this is the first post high school education I have done, I have played many sports over the years including Football, soccer, basketball, baseball, cricket, golf, athletics, softball and swimming although I’m not great at swimming. My interest in IT is cyber security, learning about all the specifications of how companies protect themselves online and how VPN’s and online safety woks. My interest in this came from my father who is one of the heads of cyber security at the BOM in Melbourne and I found his work interesting. I’ve learned the very basics in high school such as routers switches, networks and things like that but want to learn more advanced things.
<br>
<br>Ridge Patterson (s3889058)  (S3889058@student.rmit.edu) <br>
I was born in Canberra, Australia and have lived in the Nation's Capital my entire life. I completed my education in the public school system, which was where I was inspired by my Year 11 and 12 studies to further my education at the Canberra Institute of Technology. It was there that I studied a Diploma of Sports Development as well as pushing myself by completing an intensive course in Personal Training. After this I enrolled at the University of Canberra to further develop my knowledge. I started to study a Bachelor of Exercise and Sports Science, however I decided that it was no longer what I wanted to do for a living. After discussions with many people who work in different fields, I felt confident in making a switch to studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, and I have enjoyed it. While I have many secret talents something that others often find the most interesting about me is that I am Ambidextrous, however I prefer to write with my left hand making me a little different from everyone else.

                              <br><h2>IT Work (Interview):</h2>

                      1.Please tell us about your IT work. What exactly do you do? <br>
                      Cybersecurity Architect – Primarily I analyse cyber security threats and risks with a view to defining / designing solutions to mitigate those risks by applying cost effective technology, process, and physical security controls. I work with stakeholders to determine their information security needs, and then I propose solutions taking in to account various standards, any relevant government regulations or laws, any functional use cases gathered from the clients, and the cost/effort to implement and maintain the solutions. Normally I will propose 2 or 3 designs and explain the pros and cons of each design. I will work with the stakeholders or clients to determine which design best fits their needs whilst balancing any security compliance or risk considerations as well as the architectural fit within the organisation. Once a design is approved, I will work with other IT professionals who will build/test, implement and deliver the solution to the customer. <br>
                      <br>
                  2.Please tell us about the industry you work in. <br>
                      Federal Government Agency – scientific research and development. Most of the work I do is classified so I can’t be too specific however it mainly involves ensuring research systems and data is secured, and unable to be accessed by any adversarial entities. There are many people and organisations who spend a lot of time and effort trying to access or interfere with the research systems and data. My role is to be part of a team who is tasked with ensuring this does not happen, or, if it does, that any effect of unauthorised access is minimised. <br>
                      <br>
                      3.What other kinds of work do you have to do? <br>
                      Mentoring and developing team members. A lot of people are becoming interested in Cybersecurity so I am constantly asked to help people find a way to upskill or cross skill so they can enter the profession from another similar role, such as a data architect or a technical business analyst. I develop architectural roadmaps and frameworks which essentially define standards and patterns. We use patterns in Architecture so that we don’t have to start our designs from scratch. If you can imagine building a house for example, there are standards and patterns for water, electricity, walls, doors, windows etc. You do not have to design, say, a power point from scratch each time, you just specify the position, and how many plugs you want to use, and maybe the colour and the electrician will then install it based on a standard or a “pattern”.  I also participate in industry and agency workshops to network with other professionals and educate myself on how the wider industry is developing solutions or new technologies. I spend a lot of time reading about new technologies to discover better ways of developing solutions for customers. Most of my customers are highly intelligent researchers with PhD’s and the like who are leaders in their field of research, and they expect that I am equally at the forefront of what I do. This is not always easy as many researchers do not necessarily have to consider the constraints of technology, resources and cost/time. Often, they do not understand why something can’t be done simply and quickly. Balancing client expectation and the reality of what can be achieved is a constant challenge. <br>
                      <br>
                      4.Who are all the different people you interact with in your work? Please tell us about them. <br>
                      I work with Business Analysts, Engineers, Project Managers, Clients, external service providers, and other government agencies to develop fit for purpose solutions. A solution to a problem does not happen by itself. Often the Business Analyst will work with a client to develop a proposal. This will then be costed with a project Manager who will assign resources and develop a schedule. The BA will then develop the detailed requirements or use cases and then the Architects will work together to develop a design. I will then present the design(s) to the client and work with them to agree on the best one. Then engineers or software developers etc. depending on the technology, will build and configure the solution. Then testers will perform different types of testing such as functional, integration etc. to ensure each requirement is successfully met. Often the solution may need to be altered due to a requirement change (for example if a data privacy law changes, or there is a technology limitation) so then I may need to analyse the impacts of that change and any downstream effects it will have. Usually, most of my work is nearer the start of a project than the end however I am usually involved all the way a long as a consultant should there be any design issues that need addressing. <br>
                      <br>
                      5.Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals. <br>
                      I work with Cybersecurity Operations, Network support, database administrators, software developers, cloud engineers, security specialists and many other IT professionals who all support the information technology needs of scientists and researchers. When a solution is designed, an Architect needs to consider how it will be built, who will use it, how will it be used, how it will be maintained and supported, where will it be hosted, how will it be accessed. There are a lot of things to consider. Architects rely on subject matter experts (SME’s) to provide a lot of the detail and often they will provide suggestions or insights on how things are currently achieved, or what the current issues are, or how things can be improved. It is very important to listen, understand and acknowledge the feedback from the SMEs as this helps build a detailed picture of the environment and the challenges that need to be addressed. The ability to manage and maintain good relationships with fellow IT and business professionals is a very important skillset to have. <br>
                      <br>
                      6.What about your interactions with clients or investors? <br>
                      I work with clients (scientists and researchers) to understand their technology and information requirements, risk appetite, future capability roadmaps and strategies to ensure fit for purpose and value-add outcomes. Often researchers are very busy and are only really interested in what they themselves are doing. You may only get limited time with them so doing your homework before meeting them is very important. You can’t turn up to a workshop or a meeting without having done some background work. That might involve reading about their research or the projects they are working on. You need to understand their language and the terminology they use. It helps to build a trust and an understanding between you and the researchers (clients). That makes it easier to then understand what they really want to achieve rather than making assumptions or “guessing”. Some clients like to tell you what the solution to a problem is. In my experience it is better to understand the problem first and then consider their suggestion whilst analysing all the various solutions. It's better to understand what they need, rather than what they want. <br>
                      <br>
                      7.What aspects of your work do you spend most time on? Please tell us about these. <br>
                      Meetings! So many meetings. There are project management meetings, daily meetings with clients, with developers, testers, change management, operations, support staff and all sorts of other functional areas of the organization. I also attend a lot of presentations, especially to the clients. They always want updates on progress, or to see the various options, or discuss any issues that may have come up. We also have internal workshops where we learn about other projects to understand where we might be able to assist or leverage another solution, so we don’t duplicate work or negatively affect another solution. For example, we might utilize a network connection between two buildings another project has implemented, rather than build one just to meet our project needs, but we need to ensure that if we do, it doesn’t affect their solution. <br>
                      <br>
                      8.Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging? <br>
                      Working within a complex environment which has evolved over many years and utilizes a myriad technology stacks and standards. Juggling competing needs and priorities. Trying to be across the many, many projects that are happening at the same time is very challenging. Often projects will compete with each other for resources or technology and decisions need to be made on priority or where the money is best spent. In large organizations there are a lot of competing agendas and outcomes, so being mindful of personalities and egos is very important. <br>
                      <br>
                      9.Finally, can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry? <br>
                      Designing systems which ensure the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of research information, which is used to develop future technical capabilities for the Australian Government, is a rewarding and challenging IT role which involves a diverse skillset beyond just technical knowledge. What we do is important for Australia’s future and the decisions we make now, and the solutions we implement, will have positive impacts in this country for many years to come. This makes it all seem worthwhile. <br>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  IT TECHNOLOGIES: <br>
  <br>
  AUTONOMOUS VECHICLES WHAT THEY DO: <br>
  Autonomous vehicles (AV) at this stage can vary from function specific automation to full self-driving. Autonomous vehicles in their current form can do many things, its full list of current abilities is dependent on the company you are looking at. Some companies are aiming to have their cars drive on highways this year or in the next coming year. Other companies, however, are hoping for full autonomous vehicles in the next year or two and the intended application of these vehicles vary quite a lot from ride sharing services to replacing everyday vehicles for user consumption.
  So far autonomous vehicles are not available to the average person as the companies are still conducting many tests and research on them as well as continually adopting new policies and procedures around the implementation of these autonomous vehicles. “Currently, the cost of the technology required to make a vehicle autonomous varies from $8,000 to $250,000 depending on whom you consult”(LeVine, 2017)(Duarte and Ratti, 2021). The price tag of the autonomous vehicle is likely to be another issue with making it widely accessible to the average person, if the cost is too great it will be harder to have a serious impact on society and the future of driving. The next few years will be very telling, as multiple companies are hoping to be fully autonomous by the end of 2021 though this target has possibly been revised due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. The development of AV’s can be aided through new technology and the ever-evolving technology going into Artificial intelligence.
  “The decision-making process employed in the technology is based on inherent artificial intelligence (AI), hence the term “intelligent automation”. The transportation industry is only one among many industries that are increasingly influenced by automation involving inherent AI. For instance, intelligent, personal robots have begun to noticeably appear in diverse application fields ranging from home automation to medical assistance devices.” (Hengstler, Enkel and Duelli, 2016)
   The issue with Using AI technology is there is still many sceptics on how they will be used and what implications this will have on humans and society going into the future.
  According to (Davidson and Spinoulas, 2015) ”In order for autonomous cars to be available for general use on public roads, there may need to be some reconsideration of a broad range of laws. The full potential of autonomous vehicles will not be realised until the driver does not need to constantly monitor the operation of the vehicle and take over when necessary. However, this will lead to difficulties in defining who is responsible under these conditions, and who is liable for any accidents or injuries.” <br>
  <br>
  IMPACTS: <br>
  It is hard to determine what the likely impact of autonomous vehicles will be, as there are so many applications they could be used for. It could also come down to what companies find success in their technology first, we could easily have it applied to ride sharing services, such as Uber, first at a premium price or it could be released publicly but at a price only the rich and famous could afford. If they are used for the simple purpose of replacing human drivers so we can reduce the major risk of injuries and loss of life due to human error, then that would be a good result. “According to research done in Germany, human error is the major cause in more than 90 percent of the accidents, and in almost 75 percent of the cases human error is the only cause.” (Forrest, and Konca, 2021). But the impact of having autonomous vehicles could have a bad impact on the environment depending on the result of driverless cars. AVs are likely to cause a loss of jobs in the future in the transportation industry. “There are many jobs associated with transportation, including truck drivers, taxi drivers and bus drivers. It is likely that at some stage all of these jobs could be eliminated with suitable autonomous vehicles. With some vehicle improvements this could include garbage collectors, postal workers, home delivery drivers, earth movers and mining trucks. Together these account for a huge number of jobs, all of which could be displaced in a fairly short time span.” (Davidson and Spinoulas, 2015). This report shows that the usage of Autonomous Vehicles will have a big impact on many families and is likely to leave a lot of people unemployed due to Autonomous Vehicles and further advancement of technological developments.
  <br>
  AFFECTS: <br>
  If Autonomous Vehicles were easily accessible today, I think it would impact my life quite a lot, in the same way it would for most other people. With my day-to-day life I think autonomous cars would make an immediate impact in making sure I am more frequently on time for events and work, as well as the benefit of not being able to speed in a rush to get to work on time so it would help me be more time efficient. I think it would also be of extreme help for when you go out for the night with friends when everyone is drinking so that they do not have to have to Uber home and spend an exorbitant amount of money. It will also be safer if you think you are okay to drive when in fact you are over the limit or just not thinking as clearly as you should be when operating a motor vehicle.
  If they were available now if what research suggests is true it should cut congestion down on the roads quite significantly and reduce the number of crashes or simple human errors of not giving way of tail gaiting. It would also reduce the risk of fatigue on long road trips, which may also make it easy to go away with family and friends more often as you would be able to spend more time doing things in the car or even working while you are on your way to your destination. <br>

  Machine Learning: <br>
  Machine learning, also known as Analytics 3.0, is the latest development in the field of data analytics. Machine learning allows computers to take in large amounts of data, process it, and teach themselves new skills using that input. It is a way to achieve artificial intelligence, or AI, using a “learn by doing” process. (The Effects of Machine Learning | Protiviti - United States, 2021).
  Machine Learning (ML) is an application of AI (Artificial Intelligence) that allows systems to learn and improve without being programmed or supervised. (What is the Future of Machine Learning? 2021).  Machine Learning is being used in most jobs to some extent whether it is personized product placement on social media or webpages, but it is also used by account stockbrokers to determine patterns in the market or future changes. While this is not likely to change in the next few years, the likelihood that Machines Learning will be further enhanced is quite likely due to further technological advances or even artificial intelligence moving past human designs or goals. ML is traditionally broken up into three categories Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforced Learning. Depending on the company and what the requirements are will depend on what category of Machine learning they will use. Automated Machine Learning is important because it allows data scientists to save time and resources, delivering business value faster and more efficiently. Machine Learning is already more efficient than humans in a lot of aspects, which is why businesses are diversifying in ML and AI as they are going to be more cost effective in the long term but also more efficient whether that be in future predication on stock or predicting what products someone using social media will buy.
  The developments in the future could be wide ranging due to the fact that Machine Learning is generally used in conjunction with AI. We will find more retail and hospitality jobs with replaced with machines as they will be more efficient and cheaper in the long run than humans. One of the biggest impacts it could have in the next few years is Autonomous Vehicles as Machine Learning will use algorithms and risk assessments to determine the overall safety and outcomes of your journey.  <br>
  <br>
  Impacts: <br>
  Machine Learning already impacts most people in everyday life. Whether they realise it is another question. Machine Learning is all around us in affecting a vast number of industries. The more the machines get used the more they understand and evolve this will have a big impact on the future in almost all industries, the Machine learning together with AI could adapt and understand situations or outcomes better than humans in future which could help the diffuse different situations or help companies make better decisions and make the world a better place. The problem with machine learning as it is likely to change for better or worse depending on the creator/developer the machine could surpass a human’s intelligence and evolve beyond our needs and this could cause future implications that could be good or bad. ”The level of intelligence and “morality” that a machine exerts is a direct result of the data it receives. One consequence is that, based on the data input, machines may train themselves to work against the interest of some humans or be biased. Failure to erase bias from a machine algorithm may produce results that are not in line with the moral standards of society.” (The Effects of Machine Learning | Protiviti - United States, 2021) It is highly likely that more machine learning is used and the more advanced and capable it becomes the chances of it taking jobs becomes quite high. The Machine Learning can be become more efficient than humans due to higher accuracy but also due not getting tired or sleeping this means companies can take advantage and make certain jobs obsolete. We have already seen multiple companies go towards Machine Learning and artificial intelligence for multiple reasons such as Woolworths and Coles who replaced people with self-checkouts this help them reduce the space taken up instore which means more people can pay at the same time but also helps improve the amount of inventory they can hold. In the future it is likely to take more jobs or reduce the need for certain jobs in all industries.

  Affects: <br>
  Machine Learning already affects me in everyday life a lot of it without even noticing it. Machine learning is everywhere, whether in the apps we use or the webpages we click on. The biggest way it affects me is through social media as it decides what I see and what ads pop it determines whether we can see something if it determines it is against the app guidelines such as violence or offensive content. The more efficient the machine learning becomes the more targeted the companies of social media can get. This affects nearly every single person nowadays considering most people of social media. The Future of this could be very cool with machine learning being a part of AI’s the impact it could have in the future could be huge with it not having many limitations the results could be great. Most of my family and friends are probably like me I do not think they really think about the impacts of the machine learning and mechanisms behind it they just want to enjoy their free time and use the technology to try and benefit them. I think in the long run the way this technology will be used will have a huge impact on everyone whether they use technology or not. As it is people who want to avoid technology go to the middle of the woods to avoid all aspects of it and this will not likely be sustainable in the future. Machine Learning is all around us and I do not think you would be able to avoid it even if you tried.<br>

<br>Project Idea:<br>

<br> Overview:<br>

The Project that we are planning to undertake is to design an app that will assist you to pick an appropriate gift for a family member, friend or even a secret Santa gift for a colleague. The app itself will be designed with the user in mind. This means that the app we create will be user friendly and incredibly simple in its layout so that it is easily accessible to users of all generations, so that it will only take a few minutes to have the best gift suggestions for whoever you are buying for right at your fingertips. There are a few gift generators already around on the market, but we aim to be more efficient to deliver the perfect gift to your loved ones, so your gift is cherished and not tossed aside or regifted to someone else. <br>

<br> Motivation:<br>

As like many people around the world I struggle to find know what a person really wants or might like or find the right types of gift to give to my friends and family. We are going to develop an app that will help you decide what kind of gifts to give to your loved ones or whoever you are shopping for and ensure that whatever you purchase for them, they will love and cherish. There is large market for an app like this as someone who has spent hours searching for things that my loved one might like and getting stuck with too many choices. I found that all that searching would leave me feeling drained with having spent so long looking at options for no result or disappointment from the receiver. This app will give an efficient and inexpensive option to help many people. As there are few similar ideas around at the moment, we aim to have a more efficient and well-rounded app. A few of the gift idea generators that are around on the market at the moment seem to heavily focus on for him and for her when making suggestions. Our app will have more options as search filters so we can further narrow down the perfect gift for whomever you want without a heavy focus on gender and focus more on the individual. We want the final product of this app to be reasonably priced, sustainable and accurate. If we can achieve those three elements, we will be extremely proud of the final product and hopefully have investors lined up to get on board with our venture. <br>

<br> Description:<br>

This app would of consist of search filters which you can manually enter such as gender, age and likes and dislikes. It is through this layout design that the app can analyse likes and dislikes of the age range and gender of the person you trying to buy a present for leading to more successful gifting. This means the app will find out buying patterns of people similar to whom you are buying the gift for. Another feature of our app would be pairing. With this feature, the person you are buying for can pair their app to your app, this way it has quick access to the information about what that person has been buying for themselves or even what they have been searching for or even putting on their Christmas wish list. The app will also have function where the user can add a price range as some people may be on a tighter budget but still want to get the receiver a perfect gift so our app needs to be easily accessible to everyone and having a built-in budget calculator for the gift will help with this. Once the app has analysed the following data it will provide the user with a list of the five best options available to purchase. The settings of the app can be changed to suit the user’s needs, such as if you are buying for a couple or family all the users would need to do is go into the app’s settings and change them to better suit the user’s needs. The app could potentially have some obstacles in its early development, such as privacy concerns for users that would need to be expressly stated in the terms and conditions and again in user agreement. Another issue that could arise is errors in how the app is designed such as: the suggestions that app gives may not be completely accurate, so we plan to include testing the app with a big sample group, covering as many groups as possible during the testing stages to ensure that we are providing as accurate of a result as possible for our users. Sustainability in the future could be an issue as most people are most likely to use the app during busy holiday periods like Christmas, while we acknowledge that everyone has a birthday that may not be in the busy holiday period, the users are less likely to think about using the app outside those periods. For this gift generator we will also need to find funding whether that through places like go fund me or finding investors we need a clear business plan to help with future success and draw investors into out venture. Once the app is developed, we will have advertisements to generate income, or pay to upgrade to an advertisement free version of the app. <br>

<br>Technologies:<br>

This Project does not require significant use of hardware for its development, software will be the larger requirement, but we do need an up-to-date computer with a high core processor and a good amount of RAM other than that there is not much other hardware needed at this point. As for software we can use Android Studio or start with something similar to create the code or similar may already have been written that we can tailor for our needs. We can also use open-source tools such as python and Mozilla to name a few if it suits the needs of the project. <br>

<br>Skills Required: <br>

UI Design and Language Programming skills are the most important skills required to help design this app and finding people with the skills to help design the app should not be too difficult as there are so many people in the field. However, making sure the costs stay low and economical could be a challenge for the project. We also need to ensure we have enough funding to ensure the development of this app stays at a high standard, we also need to ensure that once the app is on the market that it is sustainable and make sure that there is enough funding to keep the app going into the future and enough funding to update the app regularly to ward off rival competitors and not become outdated to the public. Hardware is not a huge issue but making sure we a have a computer that has a high processor, and a lot of RAM will help the process go a lot smoother as having an outdated computer will make the process go slower and certain functions may not be compatible with an old and slow machine. <br>

<br> Outcome: <br>

If the project is successful, we will be helping people with a remarkably simple and eloquent solution. No need to spend endless hours searching in-store or scrolling endlessly online for the perfect gift. Our proposed app gives the user the best options based on data and manually entered details to help the user achieve the perfect gift for everyone. This means every Christmas or birthday users will not have to worry about whether they have gotten the right gift or be anxious about the receiver’s reaction. The user can be confident and enjoy the moment. It will also mean that we have a sustainable business plan so that the app can regularly be updated and enhanced to benefit the user and show the results are more accurate than our competitors.

<br>Group Reflections:<br>
<br>
Honestly not much went right with this assignment, for starters no one really communicated with each other until a week before the assignment was due, myself included. When it was just two days before the assignment deadline, only two out of the five people in our group were actually communicating. This has meant that two people were doing the work of five and it took the pair a longer time to submit as there was a lot more work to be completed by the two active participants of the group.
Almost all aspects of this group assignment could be improved, as two people doing the work of a group of five is not what is expected in a university group assignment. Communication especially could be improved even by myself and the other member that was replying, as it could be quite slow to respond from both parties.
I will be blunt I am surprised at how badly this group assignment went and even when the tutor asked for everyone to reply to him, I was the only one to respond. It is extremely hard to start a group assignment when there has been no communication attempt by all parties.
I have learnt that groups do not always work out the way you hope or even how the tutor hopes, and this can cause a lot of stress and anxiety for those attempting to contribute more work than should be required with a group of this size while others do not. Communication is key especially to your group but also to the tutors if there are big issues involved. <br>
